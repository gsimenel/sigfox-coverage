To open an issue, please keep in mind a few important things. First, take a look at the README docs and make sure that your question isn't already answered in the documentation. In particular, review [the configuration methods](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular#configuring-restangular) and [methods description](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular#methods-description). Then make sure you search the issues list to see if there's already an issue open that solves your problem. Then, once you've determined that your issue isn't a duplicate, here a couple guidelines to opening an issue that will be addressed easily and quickly:

- Please make sure your issue is written in a clear and succint manner, so that all the details of your issue are easy to understand and fully explained. Also, please make sure enclose your code in [fenced blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/) for readability.
- Make sure your issue includes a live Plunker (fork [this Plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/26Heuv5F6hUgxpNWNTee?p=info)), and all relevant code samples (as well as information about server responses, if relevant)
